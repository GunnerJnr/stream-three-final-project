        "post_body": "By: Ted Belfour\r\nWith a variety of gaming consoles available today, all produced by well known and high profile corporations, it can be difficult to know which one is the best to invest your hard earned money in. The choice can become even more overwhelming as technology marches on relentlessly and consoles seem to change as quickly as you can turn around, so if you are having some trouble making a choice, here are some thoughts that might just help you out. \r\n\r\nThe average lifespan, it is estimated, of a games console is about five years. That is not to say that your still working gaming equipment will suddenly and inexplicably combust after a five year period, rather that at about that time, manufacturers typically introduce a more technologically advanced version of their former console. If being at the cutting edge of technology is important to you, then purchasing a console at the start of this standard five-year period is a wise move. \r\n\r\nThat's partly why the Xbox 360 is a great choice right now. Released at the end of 2005, the technology it comprises is absolutely cutting edge, making it, according to a whole host of reviewers, the best buy available. With a wide range of features, including high quality online gaming capability and HDTV compatibility, the Xbox 360 offers a fantastic all round gaming experience. And though this version of the Xbox surpassed its predecessor after only four years, the lifespan of the previous console has been extended to a certain extent, as over two hundred of the most popular Xbox games are compatible with the new 360 version. \r\n\r\nSome gamers are holding off on purchasing the Xbox 360. Why? Because the PlayStation 3 is due out sometime this year. But while most experts agree that the PS 3 is likely to contain more technological innovation that the already released Xbox 360, the PlayStation is likely to cost up to $200 more. For the extra investment, the PS 3 will include a Blu-ray high definition DVD player - the down side of this, however, is that movies are not currently available in this format, though they are likely to surface within the next two years. \r\n\r\nThere is little question that the upcoming PlayStation will be somewhat technologically superior to the Xbox 360, but with a release date still to be confirmed, many gamers prefer not to wait to enjoy gaming of the highest quality. And with technology that will be useless to the majority of consumers for the next couple of years, for many gamers, the PlayStation 3 simply isn't worth the wait. So enjoy the moment in all its glory, and go for an Xbox 360.\r\n\r\nAuthor Bio\r\nDave is the owner of myxbox360movies.info and xbox360launchdate.info websites that provide information on xbox 360\r\n\r\nArticle Source: http://www.ArticleGeek.com - Free Website Content\r\nArticle Link: http://www.articlegeek.com/games/xbox_articles/xbox-360-gaming-now.htm",

        "post_body": "Gaming Has a Positive Side\r\nBy: Paul Wilson\r\nGaming is not just about revenue, addiction, gamers, and so on. A game being an expression of technology, developing cultural norms, and a world wide phenomenon that transcends all boundaries, becomes a source of study.\r\n\r\nGames are not mere toys, they promote:\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation literacy. Players download text files, make notes, they also take \"screen shots\" of the game and upload it with their comments. A group then examines the suggestions and discussions emerge on strategies as well as required improvements or changes.  Knowledge creation and rapid sharing is common to digital spaces. People of all ages and ethnicities from around the world pool their understanding and resources to solve problems.\r\nCuriosity and a thirst to find out more. Leading to the development of learning. Players pool thoughts and resources and try and work out how different elements function. Individual skills are sharpened using pooled resources.\r\nDevelopment of well developed research skills and the use of a huge mind boggling variety of resources. For games like \"Lineage\" a player would need to become a member of a 100 or more strong clan and in order to protect his castle or carry out sieges he or she needs to manipulate text, images, research equipment use, draw out maps, manage resources, design strategies, create and maintain treasuries, write down facts, theories, and proposals, as well as design workable models.\r\nSocial interaction and exchange of ideas and thoughts especially in multiplayer online games.\r\nAn understanding of world history. A few games are based on civilizations and take players as far back as 4000 BCE leading them through different developmental stages of the world with the creation of cities, temples, libraries, granaries, railroads and more. Many games are map based and re-enact actual events that have taken place in the world.\r\nThe setting up of virtual learning to explore new game related technologies, new gaming elements, and modes of play with peers. In fact, \"Civilization\" aficionados created \"Give peace a Chance\" in which players learn about wining by using non violence.\r\nInterpretation of data and lateral thinking. Players spend long hours absorbed in researching information, searching high and low for tips, cheats, and tricks, developing what are known as walkthroughs.\r\nCuriosity and sets the wheels of the mind clicking leading to innovations in design, software programming, graphics, strategies, and more.\r\nTeam work, a sharing of ideas, as well as collective problem solving.\r\nCompetitiveness a thirst to succeed and win.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn depth research has proven that gaming plays a role in increasing self esteem, and is motivational in many ways. Children who play games perform better at comprehension, spelling, and math.  \r\n\r\nGee, Squire, and Stienkuehler, University of Wisconsin-Madison professors, are studying learning through game playing and the advantages of gaming over traditional teaching tools truly believe that gaming has woven within its matrix important learning technologies. Learning in the e-learning world of virtual gaming is hands on, interactive, has no restrictions or boundaries, promotes collaborative working, problem solving, creating a new generation of leaders.\r\n\r\nAuthor Bio\r\nPaul Wilson is a freelance writer for www.1888Discuss.com/online-games/, the premier REVENUE SHARING discussion forum for Online Games Forum including topics on find free online games, free download games, suggest your new game and more.

        "post_body": "Best Practices For A Warrior In World Of Warcraft\r\nBy: Hunter Crowell\r\nThe Job of the Warrior is to get relentlessly beat upon.  While there are a handful of classes in World of Warcraft that have the capability to tank, the Warrior stands above them all with more talents, abilities and equipment geared for the role.  In a group setting, if the warrior dies first, they died knowing they did their job to the best of their abilities.  Some players are better at holding the agro from the monsters than others, but it's a common adage that effective tanking is 10% gear, 10% talent build and 80% skill.  \r\n\r\nA large part of effective tanking is outside the hands of the warrior.  One common fallacy held by the players of World of Warcraft is that if a tank loses control of a monster, he's a bad tank.  While this very well could be true, the case could actually be quite the opposite.  There is a limited number of things a Warrior can do to generate threat on a creature.  Assuming that the skill, talents build are in place and the gear collected, he can build a lot of threat.  There is an upper limit to the threat obtainable.  When a character is assigned to tank, he will not be generating the majority of his threat from dealing damage to a target.  Outside of the Warrior class, dealing damage is the best way to increase threat on a monster.  Over a period of time, the threat from damage caused by another character can overcome the threat generated by the tank.  In such a situation, as long as the warrior was using all his abilities to their maximum effectiveness, there's nothing else he could have done to keep the focus of the enemy.  A party who knows this, and can manage their own threat makes the tanks life that much easier.  At lower levels, the group tends to blame the tank if he loses control of the monster.  In the end game forty man instances, the smart groups tend to blame the player who pulled the target for not managing his own threat.\r\n\r\nWarriors are very dependant on the sort of gear they use.  If the goal is to play the higher intensity raid instances, a lot of time will be spent gathering up the equipment.  For a tank, there are three main things to look at while gathering gear: Stamina, Armor Rating, and Defense.  Stamina gives the character ten hit points per point.  That may not seem like a lot, but just like pennies in a piggy back, it starts adding up.  Armor Rating lowers the incoming damage percentage.  Defense ups the skill of the same name, and lowers the chance that enemies will critically hit the tank by a percentage point for every twenty five points of defense.  Thankfully, World of Warcraft offers many different dungeons to crawl in order to gather equipment with all of these perks.  On epic pieces of armor, players will find bonuses to blocking skill or dodge percentages, and those are nice too, but those will only come after time spent tanking.  There will be a long time when the characters will be relying on uncommon and rare equipment that is much easier to obtain.\r\n\r\nOf the 51 talent points World of Warcraft offers its players, eighteen of those should be dedicated to the protection tree.  For a tank to excel at his job, it is in his best interest to send points on the talents Defiance, Toughness and Last Stand.  Neither five point talent on the first tier of talents a warrior can access truly outdoes the other, one raises the chance to block with a shield, the other raises the characters natural defense.  Both are good options, yet not required for optimum tanking.  On the second tier, five points in Toughness gives you ten percent more armor contribution, and at the high armor ratings a warrior can achieve this talent can decrease all incoming damage by up to five percent.  Also on tier two is the Improved Bloodrage talent.  This two point talent is useful, but not required to tank.  It is required to gain access to the tier three talent Last Stand.  Last stand increases the warriors current and maximum hit points by thirty percent for twenty seconds, great for the times when that heal is coming just a second too late.  Lastly, the Defiance talent raises the threat generated by the warrior by fifteen percent.  Without all these talents, the warrior is not able to tank to the best of the class's ability.\r\n\r\nThe gear is in place, the talent build is good, but the most important thing to tank effectively is the skill.  Its not hard to tank.  It just takes knowledge.  Sunder Armor is the staple of every tanks retinue.  It is the most efficient way to gather rage early in a fight, and it makes the enemy easier to kill by lowering its armor rating.  Another ability widely used is Heroic Strike.  Some tanks use these two abilities and they manage to control the monster.  In a prolonged fight, this will not be enough.  There are three abilities other than sunder armor that allow the tank to gain as much agro as possible.  Shield block, while not an threat generating ability in itself, it guarantees a block, which in turn allows the tank to use the Revenge ability.  Revenge is the lowest cost and highest threat generating ability in the game.  Finally, Shield Bash, a high threat producing ability used primarily to stop a spell caster from casting can be used liberally on non-magical foes to generate high amounts of threat.  Each of these abilities should be used when they are cooled down and available.  Once the basics of tanking are understood, each individual player can add their own flavor to the game and improve on their own abilities.\r\n\r\nAuthor Bio\r\nHunter Crowell is a researcher, avid online gamer, and creator of Buy WOW Gold A site that helps players find the cheapest place to buy their gold.\r\n\r\nArticle Source: http://www.ArticleGeek.com - Free Website Content\r\nArticle Link: http://www.articlegeek.com/games/online_game_articles/world-of-warcraft-warrior-best-practices.htm",
