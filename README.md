#### Stream Three Final Project - Gamers Hub.

Gamers Hub is a fictional all purpose online community for gamers and like minded people. The idea behind it came from my passion of games and game development. Its purpose is to unite gamers and like minded people, it will give them a place to share and voice there opinions by using django-disqus to comment on blog posts. The also have the option of creating their own blog posts which can also be commented on by fellow gamers. There is a profile page of which they can set some basic information about their self. We also have a store front which will allow them to purchase any gaming product they desire, as long as we have it in stock.
